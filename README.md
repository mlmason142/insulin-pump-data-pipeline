## Welcome to the insulin pump data pipeline ##

The goal of this project is to capture insulin pump data from Tandem Source and create alerts and alarms for caregivers of Tandem Insulin Pumps. Nearly all of the code in the API folder was developed with the Tconnectsync project. This project syncs data to Nightscout and I highly recommend taking a look at it if you are interested in accessing and storing Tandem insulin pump data. 

*this project is in the very early stage. More to come*
